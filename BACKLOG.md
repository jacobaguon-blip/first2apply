# Backlog

- Quiet hours: queue messages/notifications during configured hours and deliver them when the user is back.
- Review Pushover notification functions and message format (audit call sites, payload shape, title/body conventions, action URLs, rate limits).
- Rebuild first2apply as a server version — headless probe that runs 24/7 (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi), writes to Supabase, and drives account-level notifications (Pushover) independently of any desktop client.
